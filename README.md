## This is heavy work-in-progress stuff

I'm working on this as part of my Master's thesis project in Interaction Design.

Don't expect it to work perfectly, especially when it comes to parsing and analyzing the scope. This is a proof-of-concept. Please report any bugs and suggestions.

## Install

`$ apm install scope-inspector`

## Metrics & Feedback

This is **disabled** by default.

Scope Inspector is a project I'm doing for my thesis in Interaction Design. For my research, I would like to track some usage metrics. *Please enable tracking in the package's settings view*, it will help my work a great deal.

Additionally, I am happy for any qualitative feedback I get. If you're willing to participate in an interview, please send me [an email](mailto:tim@tvooo.de).

Here's what is going to be tracked:

* Your, userId which is a hash generated through your MAC address. Same as what [Atom's Metrics package](https://github.com/atom/metrics/) does.
* Plugin is enabled/disabled
* Sidebar is toggled
* Button in bottom bar is hovered (scope highlight)
* Button in bottom bar is clicked (navigate to surrounding scope)

## Features
